# 🎗️ Histopathologic Cancer Detection Project 🎗️

Welcome to the **Histopathologic Cancer Detection Project**! This project aims to classify histopathology images as either cancerous or non-cancerous using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built in PyTorch. This README will walk you through the structure, methods, and key concepts used in building and training the model.

## 🌟 Objective

Build a high-performance classifier for cancer detection from histopathologic images.

📊 Data Overview
Dataset Details
The dataset consists of histopathology images labeled as either containing cancerous tissue or not:

0: No Cancer
1: Cancer

🔥 Model Architecture
Our CNN architecture uses 5 convolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation functions. The layers increase in depth, starting from 32 channels up to 512 channels, capturing increasingly complex patterns. Here's a breakdown:

Convolutional Layers: Feature extraction from images.
MaxPooling Layers: Reducing the spatial dimensions, focusing on important features.
Dropout Layers: Preventing overfitting by randomly dropping nodes.
Fully Connected Layers: Classification based on extracted features.

class CNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CNN,self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=0),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(32),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2,2)
        )
        # Additional convolutional layers...
Why These Layers? 🤖
ReLU Activation: Prevents vanishing gradient issues and accelerates learning.
Batch Normalization: Normalizes layer outputs for faster convergence and better performance.
Dropout: Regularization technique to improve model generalization.


🧮 Loss & Optimization
We use Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCELoss) for this binary classification task, with the Adam Optimizer to minimize the loss effectively.

criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.00015)


🌐 GPU Support
Training on GPU (if available) is enabled for faster computation. Ensure CUDA is enabled in your PyTorch installation.
# Check for GPU
train_on_gpu = torch.cuda.is_available()


📈 Evaluation
Each epoch, we track:

Training Loss: Measures error in the training set.
Validation Loss: Measures error in the validation set.
Validation AUC: Provides a measure of how well the model distinguishes between classes.
We save the model if the validation loss decreases:
if valid_loss <= valid_loss_min:
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'best_model.pt')

🤔 Challenges & Learnings
Class Imbalance: Balanced sampling prevents model bias.
Computational Power: Utilizing GPU enables faster training.
