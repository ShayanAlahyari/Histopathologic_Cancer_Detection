🎗️ Histopathologic Cancer Detection Project 🎗️
Welcome to the Histopathologic Cancer Detection Project! This project aims to classify histopathology images as either cancerous or non-cancerous using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built in PyTorch. This README will walk you through the structure, methods, and key concepts used in building and training the model.

🌟 Objective: Build a high-performance classifier for cancer detection from histopathologic images.
